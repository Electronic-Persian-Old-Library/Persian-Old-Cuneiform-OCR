# The aim of this repository is creating an OCR model for Persian Old Cuneiform

This repository is inspired from eBL project: https://github.com/Melanee-Melanee/Electronic-Babylonian-Library-eBL-documentation

## Explanation:

1. Dataset Preparation: Annotate images with bounding boxes around each character.

2. Environment Setup: Install necessary libraries and import them.

3. YOLO Training: Train a YOLO model to detect characters in the dataset.

4. OCR Model Training: Train a text recognition model (CNN) to recognise characters.

5. Inference: Use YOLO for character detection and the OCR model for recognition.

6. Visualization: Display detected and recognized text on the images.
